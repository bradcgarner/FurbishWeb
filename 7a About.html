<h1>About Furbish</h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Furbish innovates and develops living systems, primarily green roofs and green walls, to benefit the built environment. We deploy natural systems, which make economic sense for every building, to improve our health and the environment.</p>

<h2>Responsibility</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Much of our work involves measuring ecological processes and their benefits, which we attempt to do with rigor and discipline and respect for the scientific process. We are committed to accurately portraying environmental benefits, versus "<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenwashing" target="_blank">greenwashing</a>." We value third-party verification and scrutiny, such as through our partnerships with University of Maryland, The Center for Watershed Protection, and Maryland Department of Natural Resources.</p>

<h2>Science &amp; Research</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Deep research is fundamental to meaningful innovation. Our multi-faceted research and testing program includes in-house testing at our Baltimore facility and third party lab confirmation. We monitor and analyze the performance of approximately two million square feet of green roofs, maintaining extensive records, which has yielded an in-depth understanding of long-term green roof performance influencing new product development, and ongoing stewardship practices.</p>

<h2>History</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Furbish was founded in 2003 by Michael Furbish as a sustainable development company focused on high performance buildings. In our early years, we offered solar thermal, geothermal, straw-bale, and natural plasters technologies. After just a few successful projects, Furbish gained wide recognition in what was a tiny green roof industry. Furbish steadily expanded its operations to install and maintain green roofs throughout the mid-Atlantic region.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><i>Solar thermal panels on the rooftop of Lucky's Warehouse, Furbish's Baltimore headquarters.</i></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our decade of green roof maintenance has influenced product design, as we have come to realize that most extensive green roofs are too maintenance-intensive. By 2009, after installing and maintaining every green roof system in the market, we committed ourselves to offering a better system – higher stormwater performance, lower maintenance, lighter weights, lower carbon footprints, and better economies. That inspired EcoCline, now a leading green roof system in the mid-Atlantic.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Although we began as an installation and maintenance contractor, we now supply EcoCline to roofers and landscapers to install. Our seasoned installation crew is intimately involved in deployment of new green roofs and green wall technologies, often as design-build efforts.</p>

<h2>Our Home</h2>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><i>(L-R): Furbish's headquarters at Lucky's Warehouse; Interior of Lucky's Warehouse.</i></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In 2006 we bought the Lucky’s Warehouse, a 90 year old, three-story warehouse in the South Baltimore neighborhood of Brooklyn. The building is a demonstration for how we approach building systems, and is a symbol that we are willing to challenge assumptions and implement ideas. We have endeavored to redevelop and operate this property using sustainable approaches, honoring the existing masonry architecture, and attempting to exhibit our values through the built environment.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our objective has been to embrace simplicity and allow function and form to coexist. We kept the large floors open – minimizing walls and maximizing natural lighting. Our HVAC system is radiant hydronic distribution encased in polished concrete floors. Primary heat is provided by rooftop solar panels and primary cooling is ground source water. We have experienced a 65% reduction in typical HVAC costs while increasing comfort and occupant health. A BioWall provides clean indoor air. New windows improve envelope efficiency while embracing natural daylight. The exterior features a pervious parking lot and SmartSlope walls. We also use our roof, yard, and warehouse as a R&amp;D lab and incubator for our products.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Please contact us if you are interested in leasing opportunities. Vacancies come available from time to time as many of our tenants grow into their own spaces.</p>
