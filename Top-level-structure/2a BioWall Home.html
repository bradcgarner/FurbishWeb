<h1>BioWall: Vegetated Wall | Quality Indoor Air</h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img src="http://furbishco.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/biowall-25x25.png" alt="BioWall logo" style="padding-right:5px;"/><strong>Indoor air quality is one of the least discussed environmental dangers,</strong> yet one of the most serious threats affecting our health. Most of us spend the majority of our time indoors, and poor indoor air quality leaves us susceptible to serious long- and short-term health problems. BioWall is a vegetated wall that naturally filters air and removes several harmful pollutants. On top of that, BioWall offers a dramatic aesthetic – <em>a wow factor</em>. BioWall’s cost is comparable to several other high-end interior finishes. Research indicates that interior plants can dramatically increase our happiness and productivity through <a href="http://www.biophilicdesign.net/" target="_blank">biophilia</a>.</p>

<h3>Intelligently &amp; Aesthetically Designed</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>BioWall is a thin profile, closed-loop interior ecosystem.</strong> It’s comprised of tropical plants, soilless media, and a waterproof backing. BioWall thrives in a bright indoor location; energy efficient lighting can be supplemented in locations that do not have adequate natural light. BioWall reduces the demand for energy consumptive mechanical air filtration systems by harnessing the natural phytoremediation capabilities of tropical plants. This process effectively removes common airborne pollutants.</p>
