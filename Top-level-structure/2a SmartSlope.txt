<p style="text-align: justify;"><img src="http://furbishco.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/smartslope-25x25.png" alt="SmartSlope logo" /><strong>Why not be smarter about how we design retaining walls?</strong> SmartSlope is a vegetated retaining wall with unmatched strength. Furbish develops products to find more elegant ways to solve ordinary challenges. So when we tackled the problem of finding innovative eco-friendly solutions to structural retaining walls, we modeled SmartSlope on nature's multi-functional and elegant approach... and SmartSlope was born.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>SmartSlope is a vegetated retaining wall system</strong> comprised of open celled pre-cast concrete modules. The system utilizes a polymeric reinforcement strap. Each module is stacked in a staggered pattern that creates planting pockets. The pockets are filled with growth media and planted. The entire face of the wall will be covered with vegetation upon grow out.</p>
