<h1>EcoCline: High Performance Green Roof System</h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img src="http://furbishco.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/ecocline-25x25.png" alt="EcoCline logo" /><em>EcoCline: (n)</em> A gradation from one ecosystem to another with no sharp boundary; the boundary is gradual and dynamic, fostering diverse and environmentally stable communities</p>

<h3 style="text-align: center;">EcoCline is a patented thin profile green roof system that
mimics the natural growth conditions of drought tolerant plants</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As a result of approaching green roofs honestly and scientifically, we have developed technologies that dramatically improve green roof performance with an emphasis on long term sustainability. EcoCline has superior stormwater management capabilities, and is low input, truly low maintenance, and guaranteed to grow. EcoCline is designed to be truly sustainable by reducing carbon footprint, utilizing waste stream materials, requiring minimal maintenance, and minimizing nutrient runoff.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Typical installations are 2 to 5 inches deep, weighing approximately 15 to 35 pounds per square foot. For example, an EcoCline 2+2 system (4 inch depth) weighs approximately 27 lbs/sf and retains 2.2-inches of rainfall (1.5 gallons per square foot), providing stormwater performance in a 4-inch profile equivalent to a traditional 8-inch profile.

<p style="text-align: justify;">EcoCline is lightweight and suitable for use on existing structures with limited roof structural capacity. Retrofitting existing buildings within urban areas will contribute significantly to building ownersâ€™ and property mangers' ability to conform to progressive stormwater management regulations.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The system utilizes a coarse aggregate zone that is hospitable to Sedums and related species, but hostile to weeds. The primary rooting zone is composed of a range of aggregate sizes and organic matter. A high-capacity water retention layer absorbs stormwater and irrigates plants.
